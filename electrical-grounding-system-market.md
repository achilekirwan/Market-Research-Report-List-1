<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrical Grounding System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Resistance Grounded Systems</li><li>Solidly Grounded Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The electrical grounding system market primarily involves two types: resistance grounded systems and solidly grounded systems. Resistance grounded systems employ a resistor to limit fault currents, enhancing safety and equipment protection while minimizing damage during transient events. On the other hand, solidly grounded systems directly connect the neutral point of the power source to the ground, providing a low-resistance path for fault currents, which aids in quicker fault detection and system stability. Both systems are essential in ensuring electrical safety and reliability.</p></p>
