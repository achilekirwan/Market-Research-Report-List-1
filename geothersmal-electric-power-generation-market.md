<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The GeOthersmal Electric Power Generation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Steam Stations</li><li>Flash Steam Power Stations</li><li>Binary Cycle Stations</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Geothermal electric power generation encompasses three primary market types: dry steam stations, flash steam power stations, and binary cycle stations. Dry steam stations directly utilize steam from underground reservoirs to drive turbines. Flash steam power stations extract high-pressure hot water, allowing it to "flash" into steam as pressure drops, which is then used to generate electricity. Binary cycle stations transfer heat from geothermal water to a secondary fluid with a lower boiling point, allowing for electricity generation without directly using geothermal steam.</p></p>
