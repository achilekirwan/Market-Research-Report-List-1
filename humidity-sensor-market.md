<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Humidity Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Relative Humidity Sensor</li><li>Absolute Humidity Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The humidity sensor market comprises two main types: relative humidity sensors and absolute humidity sensors. Relative humidity sensors measure the moisture content in the air as a percentage of the maximum amount the air can hold at that temperature, making them ideal for applications like HVAC systems and weather monitoring. Absolute humidity sensors, on the other hand, quantify the actual mass of water vapor present in a specific volume of air, providing precise data for industrial processes and environmental studies.</p></p>
