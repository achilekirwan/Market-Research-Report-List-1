<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Optical Cutoff Filter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Shortpass Filter</li><li>Longpass Filter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The optical cutoff filter market is primarily divided into two types: shortpass filters and longpass filters. Shortpass filters selectively allow wavelengths shorter than a specific cutoff to pass through, blocking longer wavelengths. They are often used in applications like fluorescence microscopy and optical communication. In contrast, longpass filters permit wavelengths longer than their cutoff point while blocking shorter wavelengths, making them suitable for applications such as spectral analysis and imaging. Both filters play essential roles in managing light transmission in various optical systems.</p></p>
